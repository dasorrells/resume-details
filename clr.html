  <h1 id="clv-summary">Guest-Level Customer Lifetime Value & Segmentation Framework</h1>

  <p class="gray">
    “Designed a guest-level SQL and Python framework to model lifetime revenue, visit cadence, and segmentation, integrating behavioral buckets with acquisition cohorts to power strategic CLV forecasting and retention insights.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Objective</h2>
  <p>
    To develop a unified analytics pipeline that captures and segments customer behavior across years of visit history, creating a value ladder view that informs strategic retention, loyalty, and growth planning.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Engineering (SQL)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Used CTEs to define guest acquisition dates, transaction cadence, redemption patterns, and long-term engagement over 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10-year windows</li>
    <li>Rolled transaction activity into structured visit-level summaries by guest, body part, and time period</li>
    <li>Segmented by first-visit revenue, visit recurrence, time between visits, and Wax Pass activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Feature Generation (Python)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Binned guests into behavioral groups based on visit count, gap between visits, service variety, retail add-ons, and loyalty depth</li>
    <li>Created categorical flags for fast returners (e.g. 60/90/180-day second visits), Wax Pass usage, and spend mix by service type</li>
    <li>Defined CLV quartiles and applied dimension-by-metric profiling across acquisition cohorts and value buckets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Visualization & Output</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Generated waterfall charts to illustrate guest journey from first visit to long-term retention</li>
    <li>Exported segmented CLV summaries by cohort and behavioral tag to guide pricing, marketing, and operational strategy</li>
    <li>Enabled repeatable benchmarking of revenue per guest by behavior, acquisition class, and structural traits</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    This guest-level CLV framework combines detailed SQL lifecycle modeling with Python-based feature engineering to enable rich behavioral segmentation and accurate revenue forecasting. It serves as a strategic asset for defining value tiers, retention risk, and growth potential at scale.
