  <h1 id="control-summary">Control Center Assignment Process</h1>

  <p class="gray">
    “Developed an algorithm to systematically assign control centers to a control group using k-means clustering,
    geographic proximity, and other center maturity classifications.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This end-to-end solution helps identify suitable control centers for performance comparison by grouping them based
    on shared traits like location, maturity, and operational history.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    Data is pulled using SQL and merged into a unified dataset. Key metrics like guest counts and net sales are
    aggregated over time windows (3M, 6M, 12M) for both the current and prior year. Year-over-year trends are
    calculated, and additional attributes such as location, open date, and maturity classification (New, Ramping,
    Mature) are added to ensure contextual alignment across centers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Feature Scaling, Normalization, and Clustering Process</h2>
  <p>To prepare for clustering, the code applies a dual-scaling approach to normalize key features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">"Heavy" numeric features:</span> Transformed using a <code>MinMaxScaler</code> mapped to
      [0, 1], then scaled by a factor of 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">YOY percentage variance features:</span> Scaled with a <code>MinMaxScaler</code> mapped to
      [−1, 1].
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This balances absolute performance with relative trends. The elbow method is used to determine optimal cluster
    counts per maturity group, and centers are labeled accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Control Center Assignment</h2>
  <p>Each target center is assigned matched controls through a layered selection process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Finds geographically closest centers within the same maturity class</li>
    <li>Pulls additional centers from the same cluster group</li>
    <li>Excludes centers with pricing or promotional irregularities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Faster Statistical Significance Through Clustering</h2>
  <p>
    One of the biggest advantages of clustering is reducing measurement noise, which speeds up statistical validation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Variance between test and control groups is minimized</li>
    <li>Treatment effects are easier to detect due to tighter baselines</li>
    <li>Fewer weeks of data are needed to reach meaningful conclusions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This enables faster decision-making and leaner experimentation, especially in fast-paced environments where time to
    insight matters.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    This approach streamlines the process of identifying operationally similar control centers using clustering and
    standardization techniques. It improves benchmarking quality while accounting for lifecycle stages, geography, and
    performance trends. Clustering not only boosts comparability—it also shortens the path to statistically significant
    results.
