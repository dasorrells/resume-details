  <h1 id="control-summary">Control Center Assignment Process</h1>

  <p class="gray">
    “Developed an algorithm to systematically assign control centers to a control group using k-means clustering,
    geographic proximity, and other center maturity classifications.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This end-to-end solution addresses the challenge of identifying suitable control centers for comparing against
    "target" or "test" centers. Suitability in this context is determined by capturing operational similarities across
    multiple dimensions.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    The process begins with extracting data via SQL queries and consolidating it into a pandas DataFrame. Key metrics,
    such as net sales by category and guest counts, are aggregated over several time windows (e.g., 3M, 6M, and 12M) for
    both the current year (TY) and the prior year (LY). A custom function calculates percentage variances between TY and
    LY figures, providing standardized measures of each center’s year-over-year performance across various metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional attributes, such as finance opening dates, geolocation (latitude/longitude), and demographic and
    operational features, are joined to the dataset. Centers are classified into New, Ramping, or Mature categories based
    on the number of days since opening. This maturity grouping facilitates better handling of natural variability among
    centers at different lifecycle stages in the subsequent scaling and clustering steps.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Feature Scaling, Normalization, and Clustering Process</h2>
  <p>To prepare for clustering, the code applies a dual-scaling approach to normalize key features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">"Heavy" numeric features:</span> Transformed using a <code>MinMaxScaler</code> mapped to
      the range [0, 1] and scaled further by a factor of 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">YOY percentage variance features:</span> Scaled using a <code>MinMaxScaler</code> mapped
      to the range [−1, 1].
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This approach balances the influence of absolute performance metrics with relative performance changes in terms of
    YOY trendlines. Using the elbow method within each maturity class, the code determines the optimal number of
    clusters. Centers are then assigned cluster labels.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Control Center Assignment</h2>
  <p>For selecting control centers for a given target center, the pipeline performs the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Geographic Filtering:</span> Identifies geographically nearest centers within the same
      maturity class (e.g., the 5 closest "Mature" centers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Cluster-Based Selection:</span> Selects additional centers from the same maturity class and
      cluster group (e.g., 20 centers with the same K-Means cluster label).
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Exclusion Criteria:</span> Removes centers with significant price changes or unique
      promotional events.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Faster Statistical Significance Through Clustering</h2>
  <p>
    One of the key advantages of clustering is its ability to reduce measurement noise, thereby accelerating the time it
    takes to achieve statistically significant results. By grouping centers with similar operational and demographic
    characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Variance is reduced</span> between control and test groups, resulting in tighter baselines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Treatment effect signals are clearer,</span> because less noise obscures the difference
      between groups.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="highlight">Fewer weeks of data</span> may be needed to detect a meaningful difference, enabling faster
      decision-making and iteration.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These efficiencies are especially valuable in dynamic environments where speed to insight is critical for iterating
    on strategy or rolling out changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    This solution streamlines the process of identifying and clustering operationally similar control centers for robust
    performance comparisons. By leveraging advanced data preparation, dual-scaling, and clustering techniques, it ensures
    accurate benchmarking across centers while accounting for lifecycle stages, geographic proximity, and year-over-year
    trends. <span class="highlight">Clustering improves both the comparability of control groups and the speed at which
      insights become statistically valid.</span>
