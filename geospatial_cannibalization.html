    <h1 id="geospatial-framework">Geospatial Analysis Framework</h1>

    <p class="gray">“Developed analytical frameworks using Python’s Geospatial library to measure new center openings’ performance, cannibalization, and density trends in rapidly growing markets, providing actionable insights for strategic expansion.”</p>

    <h2>Background and Objective</h2>
    <p>In response to rapid market expansion, I designed and implemented a robust analytical framework to evaluate the performance and impact of new center openings. This framework focused on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantifying key performance metrics.</li>
        <li>Understanding cannibalization effects.</li>
        <li>Examining the density of nearby centers to guide data-driven expansion strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Preparation and Geospatial Analysis</h2>
    <p>The first phase of the analysis involved extracting and preparing center-level data, which included geographical coordinates, grand opening dates, and other relevant attributes. Leveraging Python’s geospatial capabilities—particularly the <code>geopy</code> library—I calculated distances between newly opened centers and existing locations. By categorizing these distances into defined bins (e.g., 0–5 miles, 5–15 miles, 15–25 miles), I efficiently identified potential cannibalization zones and overlapping customer bases.</p>

    <h2>Transactional and Financial Performance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Next, I integrated transactional and financial performance data, encompassing both current-year and prior-year figures, to construct time windows around each center’s opening date—90, 180, and 365 days before and after. Summaries within each window allowed for the computation of key metrics such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total transactions.</li>
        <li>Sales.</li>
        <li>Percentage changes year-over-year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These figures offered quantifiable insights into how new openings influenced existing center traffic and revenue performance.</p>

    <h2>Insights and Applications</h2>
    <p>By blending geospatial proximity analysis with time-window-based performance metrics, the framework revealed trends regarding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The extent of cannibalization effects.</li>
        <li>The speed at which new centers ramp up to profitability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The structured output helped stakeholders compare center performance in different regions and prioritize future openings in areas least likely to experience negative overlap. Additionally, these findings enabled decision-makers to refine site selection, predict overall profitability, and optimize resource allocation.</p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>This end-to-end analysis pipeline—encompassing data extraction, geospatial evaluation, time-window summarizations, and performance comparisons—provided a data-driven approach for strategic planning in a rapidly evolving market. By empowering stakeholders with actionable insights, this framework supports smarter, more efficient expansion strategies while minimizing risks associated with market cannibalization.</p>
