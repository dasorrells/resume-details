  <p class="gray">
    “Built a robust SQL and Python-based framework to evaluate laser service adoption, segment guest behavior, and quantify trailing purchase patterns and lifetime value across service categories.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The goal was to understand behavior and value of guests adopting new laser services, track pre-adoption habits, and model trailing engagement across service, retail, and recurring package activity.
  </p>

  <h2>2. SQL Data Foundation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Used layered CTEs to identify laser package purchasers and unify related events: individual services, redemptions, purchases, and product sales</li>
    <li>Applied filters to exclude test SKUs, refunds, and consults</li>
    <li>Joined with profile, location, and event metadata for segmentation and enrichment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Python Behavioral Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculated 365-day trailing spend and visit patterns by guest, segmented by body part and event type</li>
    <li>Derived total trailing value and repeat behavior, including recurring Wax Pass engagement and retail add-ons</li>
    <li>Aggregated into summary views by body part to inform product positioning and pricing insights</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Event Composition Modeling</h2>
  <p>
    Built functions to model the composition of guest activity across flexible timeframes (e.g., 7, 30, 90, 365 days), capturing unique combinations of services engaged in the lead-up to laser purchases.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Strategic Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Informs targeting logic for future laser campaigns based on historical mix of service behavior</li>
    <li>Provides inputs for estimating upsell potential from waxers, product buyers, and high-frequency redeemers</li>
    <li>Establishes baselines for measuring adoption lift and incremental value of laser service rollout</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    This analytics system provides a complete view of laser adoption patterns, combining precise SQL data modeling with Python-based segmentation and spend analysis to guide strategic service expansion and upsell strategy.
