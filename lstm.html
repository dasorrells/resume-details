  <h1 id="attribution-model-summary">Marketing Attribution Modeling Framework</h1>

  <p class="gray">
    “Engineered a multi-model marketing attribution framework using LSTM and XGBoost to forecast guest acquisition and quantify channel impact, with SHAP-based explainability and temporal feature engineering.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Goal</h2>
  <p>
    To develop a comprehensive analytics solution that links multi-channel marketing investments to guest acquisition outcomes, providing a foundation for forecasting, attribution, and strategic budget optimization across various time horizons.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Architecture & Inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transformed daily campaign-level spend across 12+ media channels into a structured time series panel</li>
    <li>Engineered supporting features including day-of-week indicators, holiday proximity, trailing spend trends, and prior year volumes</li>
    <li>Enabled both short- and longer-horizon forecasts to support near-term planning and long-term channel impact evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Forecasting & Attribution Models</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">LSTM Neural Network:</span> Designed for sequential modeling across configurable lookback and forecast windows, capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies in acquisition behavior</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">XGBoost Regression:</span> Deployed in parallel to provide fast, accurate predictions and explainable attribution signals using tabular inputs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Explainability & Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    To make the models actionable, SHAP was used to quantify feature importance at both global and local levels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>SHAP summary plots highlight the most influential spend channels and temporal indicators</li>
    <li>Local explanations enable diagnosis of performance drivers on specific days or weeks</li>
    <li>Evaluation metrics include MAE, RMSE, R², and naive confidence intervals to assess prediction accuracy and trustworthiness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Strategic Applications</h2>
  <p>
    This framework powers testing and optimization of marketing strategy through:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spend shift experiments across platforms (e.g., TikTok vs. Google vs. Meta)</li>
    <li>Time-based forecasting for campaign pacing and seasonality planning</li>
    <li>Budget allocation refinement based on expected guest lift or ROI projections</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="center">
    <hr />
  </div>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    The attribution system is designed for flexibility and repeatability—supporting a variety of test structures and time windows while preserving model interpretability and actionability. Built entirely in Python, it empowers data-driven marketing with real-world forecasting, channel optimization, and tactical planning tools.
