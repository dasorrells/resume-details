  <h1 id="attribution-model-summary">Marketing Attribution Modeling Framework</h1>

  <p class="gray">
    “Engineered a multi-model marketing attribution framework using LSTM and XGBoost to forecast guest acquisition and quantify channel impact, with SHAP-based explainability and temporal feature engineering.”
  </p>

  <h2>1. Goal</h2>
  <p>
    To build a replicable modeling pipeline that connects multi-channel media spend to downstream acquisition, leveraging temporal modeling and interpretability techniques to inform future marketing strategy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Architecture & Inputs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggregated 12+ marketing channels into a daily panel structure</li>
    <li>Engineered lagged features (e.g., trailing 3-day spend), 7-day trends, day-of-week one-hot encodings, and holiday indicators</li>
    <li>Used guest count (USER_ID) as the primary forecasting target</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Forecasting Models</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">LSTM Neural Network:</span> Multi-step time series forecasting with 2-day input and 2-day horizon, trained in TensorFlow with dropout and early stopping</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">XGBoost Regression:</span> Used for benchmarking and interpretability; evaluated via MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE across train/test sets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Model Explainability</h2>
  <p>
    SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was applied to the trained XGBoost model to extract global and local feature importance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Global: SHAP summary plots visualized which features consistently influenced guest acquisition</li>
    <li>Local: Force plots helped diagnose how specific campaigns or conditions influenced single-day performance</li>
    <li>Naive 95% confidence intervals were generated to contextualize forecast reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Strategic Use Cases</h2>
  <p>
    The framework is reusable for regional or campaign-level segmentation, with tunable lookback/horizon windows. It supports proactive media mix optimization and hypothesis testing for high-performing acquisition channels.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
  <p>
    This hybrid attribution framework provides both predictive accuracy and interpretability. It bridges marketing execution with analytics by quantifying impact, improving budget allocation, and surfacing key drivers behind acquisition performance.
