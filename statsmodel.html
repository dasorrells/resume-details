    <h1>CODE & PROCESS SUMMARY</h1>
    <p class="gray-quote">“Leveraged statsmodels for advanced significance testing, sample size calculations, and experimental design.”</p>

    <p>
        In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to determine statistically significant changes in center-level sales performance while also establishing meaningful baselines for future tracking. The dataset contained weekly transactions for 415 centers, focusing on both package and service sales. Here is the step-by-step approach:
    </p>

    <h2>Data Aggregation and Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sales data was initially split by EVENT_TYPE—namely Sales Wax Pass (package) versus Sales Service (service)—and then aggregated by CENTER_ID and YEAR_WEEK.</li>
        <li>The resulting <code>weekly_metrics</code> DataFrame contained total weekly sales figures for package and service sales for each center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Baseline Metrics for the Past 26 Weeks</h2>
    <p>
        To understand current performance benchmarks, I isolated data from the most recent 26 weeks. For each center, I computed the average and standard deviation of package and service sales during this period (<code>Avg_Package_Sales</code>, <code>StdDev_Package_Sales</code>, and similarly for service sales). These metrics serve as baselines to evaluate ongoing and future performance changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Statistical Significance and Sample Size Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            With established baselines for sales and YOY variance, I used the Python <code>statsmodels</code> library—specifically <code>TTestIndPower</code>—to estimate the sample sizes required to detect statistically significant changes at desired power (e.g., 80–90%) and alpha levels (e.g., 0.01 or 0.05).
        </li>
        <li>
            The calculations incorporated realistic effect sizes by using a fraction of the observed standard deviation (e.g., 10–20%) as the anticipated shift.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scenarios with ratio-based group sizes were also assessed, ensuring flexibility if the test group size differs from the control group.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
    <p>
        Translating the required sample sizes into tangible weekly or monthly goals helped guide operational planning. For example, if each center contributes a certain volume of weekly data, I estimated the duration (in weeks) needed to reach the required sample size, helping stakeholders plan the test rollout.
    </p>

    <p>
        By merging baseline metrics and YOY variance measures, this analysis provides a robust framework for ongoing performance tracking and experiment design. With clear baselines for means and standard deviations, decision-makers can quickly assess how new initiatives or market changes stack up against established norms, and do so with confidence that results are backed by statistically sound principles.
